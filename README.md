# hex2plt
A tool that converts text files with hex colour values into these palette formats:

- Photoshop swatches (*.PAL)
- Gimp (*.GPL)
- Paint.NET (*_pn.TXT)
- *.PAL

Simply drag-and-drop your txt file onto the executable (or pass it as an argument) and the program will automatically convert and export the file in all those formats.
